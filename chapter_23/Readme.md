###For your last set of exercises I'm going to have you use the help system to look up a set of commands you should research and learn how to use on your own.

Here's the list for Unix:
>`xargs`

Takes a standard input and then runs a command over each entry from that input
EX: `ls | xargs cat` would run `cat` over each file returned by `ls`

>`sudo`

Allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user

>`chmod`

Modifies the file mode bites of the listed files or may be used to modify the access control lists

>`chown`

Changes the user ID and/or group ID of the specified files
